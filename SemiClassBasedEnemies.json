					"{@bold Hemomancers.} Hemomancers, quite similar to Necromancers, are specialist spell casters controlling the machinations of death and undeath. However their power source is more close to that of a Warlock, created from a bond with a powerful commander of life and death, such as a powerful Lich, or a god of death, that allows them to use dark ritualistic forms of magic. Their power can be called upon with normal means which is often limited, or by sacrificing their own vitality, limited only by their body's health."
